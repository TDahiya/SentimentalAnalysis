# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project

## Introduction
The Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project aims to create an interactive web application that allows users to submit reviews for movies and receive sentiment analysis on those reviews. By using the power of machine learning, this project provides classification of your sentiment about various films.

## Project Objectives
- **User Engagement:** To create an engaging platform where users can share their thoughts and experiences regarding movies.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** To classify user reviews as positive or negative using a machine learning model trained on a [substantial dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
- **Dynamic Content:** To offer a visually appealing interface that showcases various movie posters and their respective titles, enhancing user experience.

## Technology Stack
The project employs a combination of front-end and back-end technologies:

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23F7DF1E.svg?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)

### Back-End:

![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/flask-%23000000.svg?style=flat&logo=flask&logoColor=white) 
![Scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-%23F7931E.svg?style=flat&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)

### Model Accuracy
Right now, the accuracy of the model is 86.40%, but in future updates, we will make sure to make it more precise and accurate.

### Sentiment Classification
Once the model is trained, it is integrated into the web application. When a user submits a review, the back-end processes the text, applies the same preprocessing steps, and uses the trained model to classify the sentiment of the review. The result (positive or negative) is then displayed to the user alongside their review.

## User Interface
The application features a user-friendly interface with the following components:
- **Movie Posters:** A visually appealing display of movie posters that users can interact with. Users can click a button to load the next poster, enhancing engagement.
- **Review Submission Form:** A simple text area where users can enter their movie reviews. Upon submission, the review is processed, and the sentiment result is displayed below the form.
- **Result Display:** After submitting a review, the application shows the user's review and the predicted sentiment, providing immediate feedback.

## Future Enhancements
The Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project has several potential impacts:
- **Expanding Features:** Future enhancements could include:
  - **Recommendation Systems:** Suggesting movies to users based on their sentiment and preferences.
  - **Visualizations:** Graphical representations of sentiments over time or by movie genre to provide deeper insights.

## Conclusion
The Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project represents a blend of technology, creativity, and user engagement. By providing an interactive platform for movie enthusiasts to express their opinions and receive immediate feedback on their sentiments, this project not only enhances the viewing experience but also contributes to the growing field of sentiment analysis and natural language processing. As the project evolves, it has the potential to foster a vibrant community of movie lovers while delivering valuable insights into audience sentiments.
